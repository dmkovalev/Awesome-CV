  Abstract                 = {The results presented in this paper contribute to the techniques for conceptual representation of data analysis algorithms as well as processes to specify data and behavior semantics in one paradigm. An investigation of a novel approach for applying a combination of semantically different platform independent rule-based languages (dialects) for interoperable conceptual specifications over various rule-based systems (RSs) relying on the rule-based program transformation technique recommended by the W3C Rule Interchange Format (RIF) is extended here. The approach is coupled also with the facilities for heterogeneous information resources mediation. This paper extends a previous research of the authors [1] in the direction of workflow modeling for definition of compositions of algorithmic modules in a process structure. A capability of the multi-dialect workflow support specifying the tasks in semantically different languages mostly suited to the task orientation is presented. A practical workflow use case, the interoperating tasks of which are specified in several rule-based languages (RIF-CASPD, RIF-BLD, RIF-PRD) is introduced. In addition, OWL 2 is used for the conceptual schema definition, RIF-PRD is used also for the workflow orchestration. The use case implementation infrastructure includes a production rule-based system (IBM ILOG), a logic rule-based system (DLV) and a mediation system.},

The principal goal of DIR is an extraction (inference) of knowledge from data. The intention of this work is to make an overview of the existing approaches, methods, and infrastructures of the data analysis in DIR accentuating the role of hypotheses in such process and efficient support of hypothesis formation, evaluation, and selection in course of the natural phenomena modeling and experiments carrying out.
An introduction into various concepts, methods, and tools intended for effective organization of hypothesis-driven experiments in DIR is presented.},

In this work, the Rule Interchange Format (RIF) dialects are used for workflow specification. Workflow elements are annotated with metadata to make their search in a subject domain possible.
The metadata model required for semantic search includes description of workflow skeleton structure, binding of workflow elements with concepts of the domain, quality and provenance requirements to data and methods. Metadata are defined in terms of corresponding ontologies. Search for workflow implementations in a collection of methods for construction of a workflow on the basis of existing relevant components is demonstrated by an example.},
